<!-- Welcome to CSE 4/573: CVIP course (Summer 2025). This website contains **_everything_ (all material)** for the course. To support engaging and interactive learning, this website is powered by [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/) and the [TeachBooks](https://teachbooks.io/) package. The site hosts all course content in an accessible and interactive format, including self-hosted animated lecture slides via [Reveal.JS](https://revealjs.com/), executable live code blocks with [Thebe](https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe), rich 3D visualizations using [Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/), spaced-repetition flashcards through [JupyterCards](https://github.com/jmshea/jupytercards), and auto-graded practice quizzes via [Jupyter Quizzes](https://github.com/jmshea/jupyterquiz). This platform enhances student engagement by blending theory with hands-on experimentation directly in the browser. -->

## About the Course

**Overview:**  
A summer course that takes students from classical computer vision foundations all the way to modern generative models and practical systems.

- Covered the full pipeline from **image formation** to **intelligent vision systems**:
  - Mathematical and physical principles of **image formation** and **camera calibration**
  - **Pixel-domain** and **frequency-domain** image processing
- Introduced **geometric methods** central to 3D understanding:
  - **Stereo vision** and **depth estimation**
  - **Epipolar geometry** and related geometric reasoning
- Transitioned into **learning-based approaches**:
  - **Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** for classification, segmentation, and object detection
- Featured a dedicated **generative vision module**:
  - **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**
  - **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**
  - **Diffusion models** and their role in contemporary generative vision
- Emphasized both **theoretical mastery** and **practical skills**:
  - Hands-on development of intelligent vision systems
  - Use of **OpenCV**, **TensorFlow**, and **PyTorch** for real-world applications


## Course Design Experience

**Overview:**  
This was the first UB course to feature a full diffusion-model module, with all generative AI content built from scratch.

- Pioneering focus on **diffusion models** at UB:
  - First course at the University at Buffalo to include a **semester-long module** on diffusion models
- Custom-designed **generative modeling curriculum**:
  - Materials for **VAEs**, **GANs**, and **diffusion models** created entirely from the ground up
  - Combined **intuitive mathematical derivations** with **from-scratch Python implementations**
- Scaffolded **assignment design**:
  - Early assignments on foundational generative modeling concepts
  - Progression to more advanced explorations of generative techniques
- Capstone project integrating **generative methods into applications**:
  - Example themes: controllable image synthesis, multimodal vision-language systems
  - Linked capstone notebook: [capstone project](capstone-project.ipynb)
- Outcome-oriented structure:
  - Ensured **early exposure** to a rapidly evolving research frontier
  - Enabled students to leave with **portfolio-ready projects** demonstrating rigor and creativity


## Teaching Philosophy and Approach

**Overview:**  
My teaching centers on intuition, curiosity, and frictionless experimentation through a fully interactive, browser-based ecosystem.

- Instructor: **[Naresh Devulapally](https://naresh-ub.github.io)**
- Core teaching principles:
  - Rooted in **intuition** and **curiosity** rather than rote memorization
  - Emphasis on making abstract concepts **tangible and visual**
- Slide and content design:
  - Every slide crafted **from scratch**
  - Rich **visuals**, **animations**, and **interactive plots** to aid understanding
  - Reinforced learning with **quizzes** and **flashcards** for long-term retention
- Live coding and interactivity:
  - **Interactive live coding** in the browser for all major algorithms
  - Implemented methods **from first principles in Python**
  - No local setup required: students could experiment **without configuring environments**
- Course technology stack and website:
  - Course website built with **[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org/)** and **TeachBooks**
  - Slides delivered via **[Reveal.JS](https://revealjs.com/)** for animated, web-native presentations
  - Executable code blocks powered by **[Thebe](https://github.com/executablebooks/thebe)**
  - 3D visualizations created with **[Plotly](https://plotly.com/python/)**
  - Spaced-repetition flashcards via **[JupyterCards](https://github.com/jmshea/jupytercards)**
  - Auto-graded practice quizzes integrated into the same ecosystem
- Overall learning experience:
  - Blended **rigorous theory** with **immediate experimentation**
  - Equipped students to **understand, prototype, and innovate** in modern Computer Vision and Generative AI
